# CI3_Plugin_System
Plugin system for CodeIgniter 3

Ill add more info to the readme later, but for now, just drop the helper/model/library where they go, import the table in the .sql file, and look at the application/controllers/Plugins.php for some info, and look at the plugins/hello_world/hello_world.php for a very basic demo.
